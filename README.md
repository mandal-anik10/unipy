# **[unipy](https://github.com/mandal-anik10/unipy)**
___________________________________________________________
A unified module for numerical calculations in physics using python.

I have a dream of making a numerical universe where I can simulate nature and physical phenomena just by incorporating the most fundamental law/infromation `(if, we will find the one most fundamental theroy of the universe)` of physics. Thhis module is in developement for that purpose. If you want to contribute, please send a mail. you can find contact information [here](https://mandal-anik10.github.io).

Checkout the [documantation](https://mandal-anik10.github.io/unipy/) for more information about this module.

    $ git clone https://github.com/mandal-anik10/unipy.git
    $ cd unipy  
    ```
- Now you should have a shell prompt ready in the `unipy` folder, and by running `$ ls` you should see a folder again called `unipy`. You can then install `unipy` with:
